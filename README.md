# Alchemy

This repository contains a variety of AHK v2 utilities that really bend OOP to
its knees. You will find things like:

- class generators
- self-generating enum classes
- cascading objects and classes (like CSS selectors)
- "chained maps"
- object viewer tools
- and a wide length of more oddities

These are some things that I've written over time for my larger projects, but
I feel like they deserve a place on their own because of their uniqueness.
AutoHotkey v2's object protocol has a place in my heart, and it allows for some
really cool patterns that are impossible in other languages.

That aside, let this be your "spellbook" of scripts, and have fun looking
around.
